      <p>Jaime Brockett grew up in Grafton and Westborough, Massachusetts. In 1969, he burst onto the thriving
        Boston/Cambridge folk music scene and achieved almost instant fame with his first release, “Remember the Wind
        and Rain.” The album went gold in part due to the popularity of "The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic," a rambling,
        13-minute version of a Leadbelly classic co-written with Chris Smither.
      </p>
      <p>
        While perpetual hassles and disputes with suits in the recording industry ultimately limited his recorded output
        to three albums in the 1970s, Jaime established himself as a dynamic and unforgettable live performer, whose
        concerts routinely inspired fans to travel hundreds of miles to catch one of his shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, Jaime has performed around the world and shared the stage with (to name a few) Joan Baez, Richie
        Havens, Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Tom Paxton, Jimmy Buffet, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, James Taylor, and Led
        Zeppelin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Jaime lives in a picturesque corner of New England, collects vintage guitars, communes with moose, and
        works to perfect his world-famous Bloody Mary and Buffalo wing sauce recipes. While semi-retired, he still
        performs occasionally, to the delight of his old fans and the new ones he adds at every show.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jaime's other albums include Jaime Brockett 2 - 1970 (Capitol Records), and North Mountain Velvet - 1977
        (Adelphi Records). A new album, “Road Dancer,” is forthcoming in 2020.

        I was wrong -- Jaime knows... Go see him and tell him I said so.' <br />-- John Gorka</blockquote>


      <blockquote>'To play and sing from the heart in "a heartless world" is
        often a thankless endeavor. Thanks Jaime.' <br />-- Paul Geremia</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"I've been listening to Jaime Brockett since I was sixteen.
        I've always thought of him as a folk entertainer, something more than
        just a folksinger or songwriter. You never know what's going to happen
        when he takes the stage and I doubt he does either. Go see him. <br />-- Bill Morissey</blockquote>

      <blockquote>'He means well.' <br />-- Jaime's mom</blockquote>
