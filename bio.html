          <p>Jaime Brockett grew up in Grafton and Westborough, Massachusetts. In 1969, he achieved almost instant fame with "The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic." That popular song is Jamie's rambling, 13-minute version of a Leadbelly classic, co-written with Chris Smither.

            Today, Jaime lives in a picturesque corner of New England, collects vintage guitars, and nods at armadillos as he passes them en route his next concert.

          <p>

            Jaime has always filled his movie (aka, his life) with adventures, great music, witty dialogue, and clever observations. He sees his life through sunny yellow lenses as he roams from one coffeehouse or club (and grateful audience) to the next.

            Jaime is well-respected as a musician since he made his mark on folk music in the late 1960s. His first album, Remember the Wind and the Rain, attracted loyal fans who -- more than 30 years later -- sometimes drive hundreds of miles for one of Jaime's performances.

          <p>

            Jaime's other albums include: Jaime Brockett 2 - 1970 (Capitol Records), North Mountain Velvet - 1977 (Adelphi Records), and Road Dancer - 1996, (Private release).
          </p>
          <p>

            Jaime's music has evolved far beyond "The Legend of the U.S.S. Titanic." In his 21st century performances, Jaime's original observations are as appreciated as his songs.

            Jaime Brockett is a folk music icon, an entertainer on- and offstage, and he's still legendary for his sizzling, pan-fried steaks.

          <blockquote>'When I made my first album, I titled it "I know,"
              I was wrong -- Jaime knows... Go see him and tell him I said so.' <br/>-- John Gorka</blockquote>
  

          <blockquote>'To play and sing from the heart in "a heartless world" is
              often a thankless endeavor. Thanks Jaime.' <br/>-- Paul Geremia</blockquote>
  
          <blockquote>"I've been listening to Jaime Brockett since I was sixteen.
            I've always thought of him as a folk entertainer, something more than
            just a folksinger or songwriter. You never know what's going to happen
            when he takes the stage and I doubt he does either.  Go see him. <br/>-- Bill Morissey</blockquote>
     
          <blockquote>'He means well.' <br/>-- Jaime's mom</blockquote>
